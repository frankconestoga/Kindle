Here is the information from the assignment images, converted into a text document:
Assignment 1
Creating a BookStore Shopping Web App
1. Create a new ASP.NET core Web Application using .NET Framework.
2. Name the app as YourName_BookStore.
3. Make sure the Default.aspx is set as the start page.
4. Design the Default page with the navigation of the below links:
   * Home
   * Products
   * Cart
5. Your app should have three web forms for the above pages. Create the required web forms.
   * Default.aspx (Home Page, this is already there)
   * Products.axpx (Products Page)
   * Cart.aspx (Cart Page)
6. Design and code the Products Page. You can refer to the shopping cart you have created in the class for this. Use custom CSS.
   * The page should display a "Please select a product:" dropdown list (e.g., showing "Flying Bats").
   * Below the dropdown, display the product details:
      * Product Name (e.g., "Flying Bats")
      * Short Description (e.g., "Bats flying in front of moon")
      * Long Description (e.g., "Bats flying in front of a full moon make for an eerie spectacle.")
      * Price (e.g., "$69.99 each")
      * An image of the product (e.g., a Halloween-themed decoration with bats and a moon).
   * Include a "Quantity:" label with a text input box.
   * Add two buttons: "Add to Cart" and "Go to Cart".
7. Design and code the Cart Page. You can refer to the shopping cart you have created in the class for this. Use custom CSS.
   * The page should have a heading "Your shopping cart".
   * It should display a list box or similar control showing the items in the cart with their quantity and price (e.g., "Austin Powers (1 at $79.99)", "T&L Machine (1 at $99.99)").
   * Add a "Remove Item" button and an "Empty Cart" button.
   * Below the cart items, add two buttons: "Continue Shopping" and "Check Out".
8. Make sure all the web pages in your app use custom CSS and are uniform.
9. Create a new database called - yourname_bookstore. Make sure you store this database file in the Model folder in your project structure.
10. Create the below tables:
   * Genre
   * Books
11. Populate the table with proper relevant data. Make sure you have at least 6-7 different genres and each genre consists of 4-5 books. There are millions of books out there in the world. Explore and add unique data.
12. Use SQLDataSource control to populate your Products.aspx with your database.
13. Create a business class called Book.cs and add model schema based on the table data you have for storing the books.
14. Use this Book class to modify the Products and Cart page further.
15. Create a new web form called Checkout.aspx.
16. Once the user clicks on the Checkout button from the Cart.aspx, it should redirect to the Checkout page.
17. Design this as below:
   * Design a form to take the data from the user for check out. Use proper controls like calender (for date-of-birth), proper regex for zip code, phone number and emails, etc.
   * Add a button for "Go back to Cart" (Navigates to Cart.aspx)
   * Add a button for "Place Order" (Displays a message saying "Order Placed" and clears the cart and checkout form)
   * The Checkout Page should have sections for:
      * Contact Information:
         * Email Address (input field)
         * Email Re-entry (input field)
         * First Name (input field)
         * Last Name (input field)
         * Phone Number (input field, with a "Phone number is required." error message if left blank)
      * Billing Address:
         * Address (input field)
         * City (input field, with a "City is required" error message if left blank)
         * State (dropdown list, with a "State is required" error message if unselected)
         * Zip code (input field)
      * Optional data:
         * Checkboxes for "New products", "New editions", "Special offers", and "Local events".
         * Radio buttons for "Please contact me via:": "Twitter", "Facebook", "Text message", and "Email" (with Email selected by default).
      * Buttons: "Check Out", "Cancel Order", "Continue Shopping".
18. Use proper validation controls and a validation summary to handle the Checkout.aspx.
   * The page should display a validation summary at the top, listing errors like "Email address", "Email re-entry", "Phone number", and "Billing state".
   * Individual fields should show specific error messages:
      * "Must be a valid email address" for the Email Address field.
      * "Must match first email address" for the Email Re-entry field.
      * "Use this format: 123-456-7890" for the Phone Number field.
      * "Required" for the State dropdown.
19. Make sure you've tested and debugged the app for any errors. Use proper error handling statements in your code behind files.
When you have completed the assignment, zip up your files and submit them to the attached dropbox.
